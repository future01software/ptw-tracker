 Ensure job description is clear and accurate on the Permit to Work Form;
 In consultation with the permit recipient, discuss the hazards and their control measures
associated with the work;
 Assess the potential impact on other work groups, lessees, port users, neighbouring
property owners, housekeeping and plant;
 Verifies that plant and equipment being brought onto site is compliant and safe.
 Verifies that the work area is made safe before allowing the job to begin, e.g. ensure LOTO
has been applied etc. (refer to Lock-Out Tag-Out Procedure);
 Ensures that all required isolations to perform the work are in place;
 Verifies that other documented controls such as physical barriers, signs, emergency
equipment, identified on the Permit to Work are in place and the remaining risk is
acceptable;
 Verifies all persons engaged in the work have training certification for work to be
performed. i.e. Confined spaces training certification etc.; and
The Permit to Work shall be kept on the job at all times while work is proceeding and a record
(copy) of the Permit to Work shall be retained by the permit issuer as a record of work in
progress.
Record Permit details in the Permit to Work Control Log in TRIM.
4.1.2 Multiple Permits
Where a worker is conducting an activity outlined in the Permit To Work and it is indicated in
the Permit that additional Permit/s are required, ie excavation, high voltage etc., these
additional permits must be issued in accordance with 4.1.1 Permit to Work. Exceptions to this
are the issuing of Crane Permits as described in 4.1.3.
4.1.3 Crane Permit
 Crane company or work planner is to send a copy of permit to
cranepermit@Tasports.com.au with location, company, contract details etc. on page 1 and
lift details on page 2 of the permit completed for engineering assessment and approval a
minimum of 3 working days prior to proposed to proposed start of work.
 Tasports Engineering Department will seek preliminary approval from the site Operations
Supervisor for the works.
 Once Engineering has approved the Crane Permit, they will input the engineering approval
details into the permit to work log in located in TRIM. A unique site crane permit number
(generated from TRIM) will be noted on the crane permit.
 The Engineering Department will return the approved crane permit back to the Crane
Company or work planner.
 Where indicated, crane drivers MUST report to Tasports Operations Supervisor onsite with
approved permit which MUST be signed prior to the commencement of work and at the
completion. Work out of hours may require alternate arrangements to be made.

be issued where a job task changes.
In the event of a change of the Permit Issuer responsible for the work area, the new Permit Issuer shall discuss
the work being performed and the precautions in place with the original Permit Issuer and Permit Recipient, if
satisfied, shall countersign the Permit to Work.
If it is necessary to test run equipment or test circuits, the Permit Issuer must ensure that Tasports

Step 3
 The outgoing Permit Issuer signs “Permit Issuer Handover” section of the form.
Step 4
 Incoming Permit Issuer:
 Signs “Accepted By” in the “Permit Issuer Handover” section on the form; and
 Signs onto relevant permits (Masters and dependants)
Note: Step 4 must be done just before or immediately after the outgoing Permit Issuer signs off (step 3).
